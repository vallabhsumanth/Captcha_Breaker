### Model Description: Captcha Solver Using CNN with L2 Regularization
The CaptchaSolver model is built to break captchas using deep learning techniques, specifically employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with L2 regularization to accurately recognize and classify captcha characters. This model is designed to detect and solve captcha images by training on a dataset of labeled captcha images, and then using the trained model to predict new captchas.

# 1. Model Architecture
The architecture of the model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are particularly well-suited for image-related tasks, as they automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, making them ideal for captcha recognition.

# Model Layers:
# Conv2D Layer (Convolutional Layer):
The model starts with a Conv2D layer that uses 64 filters, each of size 3x3, and applies the ReLU activation function.
This layer extracts low-level features (such as edges, shapes, and textures) from the input images.
MaxPooling2D Layer:

After the convolution operation, a MaxPooling2D layer with a 2x2 pool size is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. This helps in reducing computational complexity while retaining important features.
Conv2D Layer (Second Convolutional Layer):

The second convolutional layer uses 128 filters with a 3x3 kernel size, again followed by the ReLU activation function.
L2 regularization is applied here to penalize large weights, helping the model avoid overfitting.
MaxPooling2D Layer (Second Pooling Layer):

Another MaxPooling2D layer is applied to further downsample the feature maps and reduce spatial dimensions.
Flatten Layer:

After the convolutional and pooling layers, the output is flattened into a 1D vector to pass into the fully connected (dense) layers.
Dense Layer (Fully Connected Layer):

The model includes a Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation to learn high-level representations of the features. L2 regularization is applied here to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model doesn't become too complex.
Dropout Layer:

A Dropout layer with a rate of 0.5 is added to randomly drop 50% of the neurons during training to further help prevent overfitting.
Output Layer:

The final output layer is a Dense layer with a number of neurons equal to the number of classes (captchas to recognize), using the Softmax activation function to produce class probabilities.
The Softmax function ensures that the output probabilities sum up to 1, where the class with the highest probability is the modelâ€™s predicted class.
2. L2 Regularization
L2 regularization (also called Ridge regularization) is applied to both convolutional and dense layers. This regularization technique adds a penalty to the loss function, encouraging the model to keep the weights smaller and prevent them from growing too large.

## 3. Model Training
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. Adam is a popular optimization algorithm because it adapts the learning rate during training, which often leads to faster convergence and better performance.
Categorical Crossentropy is used as the loss function, suitable for multi-class classification problems like captcha character prediction.
Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric, as it directly reflects the model's ability to predict the correct characters in the captcha images.
4. Data Augmentation
To improve the model's robustness and prevent overfitting, data augmentation is applied to the training images. This involves applying random transformations like:

Rotation (up to 20 degrees)
Width and Height Shifting
Shearing
Zooming
Horizontal Flipping
These augmentations artificially expand the training dataset, making the model more generalizable and less likely to memorize the training data.

## 5. Model Evaluation and Prediction
After training the model, predictions can be made on new captcha images. The model outputs class probabilities, and the character corresponding to the highest probability is selected as the predicted class.
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy on a separate test set that was not seen during training.

## 6. Performance
The model achieves high accuracy (close to 100%) on the test dataset, showing that it has learned to recognize and decode captchas effectively.
It is capable of recognizing a variety of captcha formats, depending on the dataset it was trained on.
